# Add 2 more models: for example Comments and ???

# Admins - at least 2 groups of admins:
# One must have permission to do full CRUD functionalities (superusers);
# The other/s have permission to do limited CRUD functionalities (staff).
# User roles could be manageable from the admin site.
# Make sure the role management is secured and error-safe.
